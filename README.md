# Expert-Expenses
Everyone has lots of expenses to keep track of whether itâ€™s through various credit cards, accounts, etc. This repository will become a web app with a presentable user interface where the user can add information with ease. For example you can add the place you bought it and the amount. Then it will sort that data into a formatted table that will have respective value totals for the user to keep track of over time. In the future my goal is to convert this into a mobile app using swift.
